# Calibration
Calibration of ground motion models using stochastic area metric



This code is used to obatain different models with minimum area metric inorder to obtain the calibrated models.
An ecdf is constructed and the confidence bounds are calculated using Dvoretzky–Kiefer–Wolfowitz inequality.
Different models are analysed to get the models within the confidence band.
